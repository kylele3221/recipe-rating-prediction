## Project Summary

- Can nutrition facts like calories, fat, or protein predict how well a recipe is rated?
- What nutrition features are most associated with higher or lower user ratings?
- This project demonstrates basic exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, fairness analysis, and regression modeling.

See the [project website](https://kylele3221.github.io/recipe-rating-prediction/) for the full, readable write-up and all visualizations.
