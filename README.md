## Quick Project Summary

We use a dataset of recipes and user ratings scraped from [food.com](https://www.food.com/). The project explores:

- Whether nutritional facts like calories, fat, or protein can predict how well a recipe is rated.
- Which nutritional factors might be associated with higher- or lower-rated recipes.
- Data science and ML techniques for exploratory analysis and basic prediction.
